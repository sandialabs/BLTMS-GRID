BLTMS-GRID was created to faciliate the development of a 2-dimensional rectangular finite-element grid specification specifically 
for use in a model running the Breach, Leach, and Transport - Multiple Species (BLT-MS) code for low-level radioactive waste 
disposal performance assessment.  BLTMS-GRID queries the user for several options in order to generate the grid specifications.  
Output is in the form necessary for input to the BLT-MS.  The user then has to cut-and-paste the contents of the output file into an
appropriate BLT-MS input file.  The code is written for use with a DOS window.
